# Animations
- Animations comes into play when multiple states needs to be maintained or controlled (A situation where using Translate alone wiull not suffice)
- Animations consist of two components; A style describing the animation and a set of keyframes indicating the start and end states of the animation as well as intermediate points
- Keyfarmes define the stages which the animation is used
- Animation properties assigns the @keyframes to specific CSS element and define how it is animated 

## Keyframes
- Keyframes are defined by stating the "@keyframes" rule and its followed by an identifier. This identifier can be named at the discretion of the developer and it what is used to invoke the animation on the CSS element. within this keyframe block the "from" and "to" rules are specified as well as other intermediate states as the need arises.
